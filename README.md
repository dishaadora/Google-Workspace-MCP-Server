# Google Workspace MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a secure bridge between your personal Google Workspace account (Gmail, Calendar, etc.) and any MCP-compatible AI client, such as a custom agent built with `mcp-use`.

## The Concept: Your Personal AI Assistant

Large Language Models are incredibly powerful, but they are limited by the information they were trained on. They don't know about your schedule, your emails, or your personal data.

This MCP server solves that problem. It securely connects to your Google account and exposes specific functionalities (like "read the last email" or "create a calendar event") as **tools** that an AI can use.

Imagine giving your AI agent a task:

> "Read my last email and create a calendar event based on its content."

With this server running, the AI can:
1.  Call the `read_latest_gmail_email` tool to get the content of your email.
2.  Understand the context and details for an event.
3.  Call the `create_calendar_event` tool to add it directly to your Google Calendar.

All of this happens through a secure, permission-based flow, giving you a powerful, personalized AI assistant that can automate your daily tasks.

## Features

Currently, this server supports the following tools:

*   **Gmail**:
    *   `read_latest_gmail_email`: Fetches the snippet and body of the most recent email in your inbox.
*   **Google Calendar**:
    *   `create_calendar_event`: Creates a new event in your primary calendar.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the server and run the example AI agent.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ and `uv` (or `pip`).
*   A Google Cloud project with the necessary APIs enabled.
*   An LLM API Key (e.g., from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) for the client.
*   The `mcp-use` library and its dependencies.

### Step 1: Configure your Google Cloud Project

You need to authorize this application to access your Google data. This is a one-time setup.

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console**: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2.  **Create a new project** (or use an existing one).
3.  **Enable APIs**:
    *   Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Library".
    *   Search for and **Enable** the **Gmail API**.
    *   Search for and **Enable** the **Google Calendar API**.
4.  **Create OAuth Credentials**:
    *   Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials".
    *   Click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID".
    *   If prompted, configure the "OAuth consent screen". Choose **External** and provide a name for the app. You can skip most other fields for personal use. Add your Google account email as a Test User.
    *   For "Application type", select **Desktop app**.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "GSuite MCP Client").
5.  **Download Credentials**:
    *   After creating the client ID, click the "Download JSON" icon.
    *   Rename the downloaded file to `client_secrets.json` and place it in the **root directory of this project**.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Clone this repository and install the required Python packages for both the server and the client.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
uv venv # Create a virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# Install server and client dependencies
uv install -r requirements.txt
uv install mcp-use langchain-openai python-dotenv
```

### Step 3: Run the One-Time Authorization

Before you can run the server, you need to authorize it with your Google account. Run the `get_credentials.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python get_credentials.py
```

*   This will open a browser window.
*   Log in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions.
*   After you approve, the script will automatically create a `token.json` file in the project directory. This file stores your authorization tokens so you don't have to log in every time.

### Step 4: Set Up and Run the AI Agent Client

Instead of a pre-built application, we will use `mcp-use` to create a powerful, custom AI agent that can interact with our server.

1. **Create a .env file**
    Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory to store your environment variables.

2.  **Set Your LLM API Key**:
    ```bash
    # .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ```

3.  **Set Your Server Path**:
    ```bash
    # .env
    MCP_SERVER_ABS_PATH="<your server abs path>"
    ```

4.  **Create the Client Script**:
    Create a file named `mcp_client.py` and add the following code. This script defines an agent that uses an OpenAI model to interact with your GSuite MCP server.

    ```python
    # mcp_client.py
    import asyncio
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from mcp_use import MCPAgent, MCPClient

    from config import MCP_SERVER_ABS_PATH

    async def main():
       load_dotenv()
       config = {
          "mcpServers": {
             "gsuite": {
                "command": "python",
                "args": [f"{MCP_SERVER_ABS_PATH}"],
             }
          }
       }

       client = MCPClient.from_dict(config)

       llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

       # Create agent with the client
       agent = MCPAgent(llm=llm, client=client, max_steps=30)

       result = await agent.run(
          """
          Create a Google Calendar Event based on the content of the last mail being sent to my inbox.
          If you cannot create an event, create a sort of "reminder event" in order to remind me to check that email. 
          """,
       )
       print(f"\nResult: {result}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
    ```

4.  **Run the Agent**:
    Now, execute the client script from your terminal.

    ```bash
    python mcp_client.py
    ```

The script will automatically start your GSuite MCP server, connect to it, and run the specified task.

## Roadmap & Future Plans

This server is the foundation for a much larger vision. The goal is to provide a comprehensive MCP server for the entire Google Workspace suite. Future additions will include tools for:

*   ‚úÖ **Gmail** (reading)
*   ‚úÖ **Google Calendar** (creating events)
*   üìù **Google Docs**: Create, read, and append to documents.
*   üìä **Google Sheets**: Read data from sheets, append new rows, and even perform calculations.
*   üóÇÔ∏è **Google Drive**: List files, download content, and upload new files.
